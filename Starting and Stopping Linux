Explanation of each directory under /
1. bin
Stands for binaries.
Contains essential command programs needed by all users (e.g., ls, cp, mv, cat, date).
These are available even when only the minimal system is running.
2. boot
Contains files needed for the boot process.
Includes the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs), and bootloader (like GRUB) files.
3. dev
Contains device files.
In Linux, everything is treated as a file (hard drives, USB, printers).
Examples: /dev/sda (first hard disk), /dev/null, /dev/tty.
4. etc
Stands for editable text configuration.
Contains system configuration files (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/fstab).
Almost all software/system settings live here.
5. home
Contains personal directories for each user.
Example: /home/john or /home/halima.
Each user keeps their documents, downloads, configs, etc. here.
6. lib and lib64
Store shared libraries (similar to DLL files in Windows) required by programs in /bin and /sbin.
lib64 is for 64-bit libraries on 64-bit systems.
Example: files like libc.so.
7. media
Temporary mount point for removable media like CDs, DVDs, USB drives.
Example: when you plug in a USB, it may mount under /media/username/USB.
8. mnt
Stands for mount.
Traditionally used by admins to manually mount file systems (e.g., another hard disk or network share).
Still used today for temporary mounts.
9. opt
Stands for optional.
Used for installing optional or third-party software packages.
Example: /opt/google/chrome when Chrome is installed manually.
10. proc
Virtual filesystem that shows system and process information.
Example: /proc/cpuinfo (CPU info), /proc/meminfo (RAM info), /proc/[pid] (running processes).
It doesn’t exist on disk; it’s created by the kernel.
11. root
The home directory of the root (admin) user.
Example: instead of /home/root, the superuser’s home is /root.
12. run
Temporary filesystem (in RAM) used since system boot.
Stores runtime data like process IDs (PIDs) and sockets.
Example: /run/systemd stores systemd runtime info.
13. sbin
Stands for system binaries.
Contains essential administrative commands (e.g., shutdown, mount, fsck).
Regular users don’t usually use these; mostly for root/admin.
14. srv
Stands for service.
Used to store data for server services (like web server /srv/www, FTP server /srv/ftp).
Not always used, depends on setup.
15. sys
Virtual filesystem that exposes information about devices and kernel.
Used by system utilities to manage hardware.
Example: /sys/class/net lists network interfaces.
16. tmp
Temporary files storage.
Any user or program can store temporary data here.
Usually auto-cleared on reboot.
Example: when you open a document in an editor, it may create backup temp files here.
17. usr
Contains the majority of user applications and utilities.
Inside:
/usr/bin → most user commands.
/usr/sbin → admin commands.
/usr/lib → libraries.
/usr/share → shared data (docs, icons, etc.).
18. var
Stands for variable data.
Stores files that change often.
Example:
/var/log → system logs.
/var/spool → print queues, mail queues.

/var/cache → cached files
