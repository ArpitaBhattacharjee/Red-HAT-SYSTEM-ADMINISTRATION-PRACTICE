##In this I learned the basic of Shell prompt and Shell
##Commands practised:
-int 6 (restart linux computer)
- ~# (root administrator prompt)
- ps (which shell is running)
- echo $SHELL (which shell is running)
- csh (to check if c shell is running) ps (to check we run ps command after csh)
- tcsh following ps (TENEX C Shell ,it remembers command history,completes commands or file name automatically,uses syntax similar to C programming language)
- exit (logs out from previous shell and logs out from the session)
