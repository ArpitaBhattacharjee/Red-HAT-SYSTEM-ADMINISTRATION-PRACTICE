##In this I learned the basic of Shell prompt and Shell
##Commands practised:
-int 6 (restart linux computer)
- ~# (root administrator prompt)
- ps (which shell is running)
- echo $SHELL (which shell is running)
- csh (to check if c shell is running) ps (to check we run ps command after csh)
- tcsh following ps (TENEX C Shell ,it remembers command history,completes commands or file name automatically,uses syntax similar to C programming language)
- exit (logs out from previous shell and logs out from the session)
-command -option arguments
-cal -y (command,option)
-cal 8 3050 (command,option,argument)
-date
-ls (listing command)
-ls -l (long listing format)
-cal ; cal 7 2026 ; date (issuing more than one command)
Piping Command
~]# cd / (~ tilt-home directory, / - root ,cd-change the directory,ls- files and directories in the current working directory)
/]#ls (/-root partition)
/]#cd /etc (/etc contains configuration files for the system and installed applications,cd/etc-cd used to change directories,in this case used to navigate th /etc directory)
etc]#ls (ls command will display the list of files and directories inside /etc)
#ls /etc | more  (|-piping sign,to check in column process)
for More we press space bar,Q button to get out of piping section
#history (previous all commands)
history | more
!21 (we can use the numbers from history list to repeat the command)
history -c (to clear history)
